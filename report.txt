Cloud-Based Inventory Management System Implementation Details
Since this was for a company project the code or the images are not shared publicly.
1. Data Acquisition:

Data Sources: Integrated various data sources: internal applications, external APIs, and manual data entry points.
AWS Service: Configured Amazon SQS as a message queue to buffer incoming inventory data. This ensures smooth data flow and prevents data loss during peak loads.
2. Data Processing & Storage:

Worker Service: Developed Python scripts using AWS Lambda functions to process data received from the SQS queue.
Data Transformations: Implemented data cleaning and validation logic within the Lambda functions to ensure data quality before storage.
Database: Deployed Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL as a secure and scalable storage solution for structured inventory data.
Data Warehouse (Optional): Optionally set up Amazon Redshift as a data warehouse for storing historical inventory data. This facilitates deeper analysis with tools like Tableau.
3. User Interface & Management:

Web Application: Built a user-friendly web application using the Django framework to provide an interface for inventory management tasks.
API Gateway: Implemented API Gateway to manage API requests to the backend services, ensuring efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
User Authentication: Integrated AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization to enhance system security.
4. Inventory Management Logic:

Backend Services: Developed backend services using Python with AWS Lambda functions for core functionalities:
Adding/updating inventory data.
Generating reports.
Triggering low-stock alerts.
5. Monitoring & Analytics:

Monitoring: Configured Amazon CloudWatch to monitor system health and performance metrics in real-time.
Auditing: Implemented Amazon CloudTrail to track API calls and user activity for audit purposes and ensuring security compliance.
Data Visualization: Integrated Tableau with Amazon Redshift (if used) to provide insightful dashboards for inventory data analysis.
Enhancements:

Alerting: Incorporated Amazon SNS for sending real-time alerts to relevant stakeholders regarding inventory levels.
Static Assets: Utilized Amazon S3 for storing static assets used by the web application, improving scalability and performance.
This implementation leverages a combination of AWS services and open-source technologies (Django, Python) to create a robust, scalable, and cost-effective cloud-based inventory management system.
